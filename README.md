# Dual y-axis plot in a single figure

Python functions to quickly visualize and export two different series as a pyplot figure that has a primary and secondary y-axis. Both series must be the same length.

`dualplot.line_line` is for plotting two different series as line charts on a single figure.

`dualplot.bar_line` is for plotting two different series on a single figure. The first series is plotted as a bar chart, the second one as a line chart.
